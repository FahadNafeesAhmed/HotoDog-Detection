# HotoDog-Detection
This project implements a full machine learning pipeline for Hotdog Detection, inspired by the "Silicon Valley" Hotdog/Not Hotdog app. Using a YOLO-based object detection model, it trains on a dataset of hotdogs with annotated bounding boxes to accurately detect and localize hot dogs in unseen images. The pipeline covers data preprocessing, bounding box format handling, augmentation, model training with transfer learning, and evaluation using metrics like mAP and IoU, along with qualitative visualization of predictions. Built with Python, PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLO, and OpenCV, this project demonstrates end-to-end object detection development and can be extended to multi-class food detection tasks.
